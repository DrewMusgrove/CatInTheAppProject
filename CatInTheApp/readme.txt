I downloaded a HTML template for the front end of the web application to save time creating this myself, and my front end development skills are not the best (Needs improving!)\

All back end development was done myself, this was the first time I have used a API so unsure if I used it in the correct way, however it seems to be working okay (A little slow on start up\'85)\

The packages folder isn\'92t included, hopefully when running the application via Visual Studio these should automatically be download. I can send these over if needed.}

Testing needs to be done reharding the rating css, seems to be working okay on Macbook Pro 2015 Google Chrome however on Windows 10 Machine Google chrome, positioning seems to be off.
